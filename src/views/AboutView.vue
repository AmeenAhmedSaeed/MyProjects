                    Starting our transformation toward a new and reformed Royal
                    PharmaAs we celebrate our 13th anniversary in 2019, we are
                    truly grateful for all of our employees, business partners
                    and customers for their continuous support. Since the
                    company was established in 2006, Royal Pharma has gone
                    through several growth and development stages until it
                    reached its current status as a major supplier of
                    pharmaceuticals and medical devices in Yemen.The local
                    business environment has experienced drastic changes in the
                    last The local business environment has experienced drastic
                    changes in the last few years. The exit of major local
                    suppliers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices from the
                    market and the entry of more competitive new ones have
                    re-sulted in opportunities as well as threats. Furthermore,
                    the deteriorating so-cio-economic status and the changing
                    geopolitical landscape in Yemen makes the survival of
                    existing business a great challenge. With facing such
                    challenges, we at Royal Pharma are required to achieve a
                    dramatic reform and a major shift from a corporate that
                    largely depends on distributing highly competitive and low
                    priced pharmaceuticals to an enter-prise that provides
                    specialty products and medical solutions. This is while
                    keep-ing focused on the existing business model and
                    philosophy. By encouraging our staff members to proactively
                    identify perpetually chang-ing market needs and discover new
                    opportunities, Royal Pharma will be much better equipped to
                    double its turnover via expanding the range of product
                    portfolio and proposing an appropriate medical solutions.
                    Our goal is to drive growth and expand our market presence
                    in key therapeu- tic categories, particularly within
                    prescription pharmaceutical business and lifesaving
                    therapeutic solutions. Furthermore but not less important,
                    we shall im-prove our compliance to the international
                    regulatory standards pertaining to storage and distribution
                    of pharmaceutical and medical devices products. We will also
                    look to further expand and diversify our portfolio and
                    optimize the potential of our local commercial network.We
                    want to be judged by our customers on our adherence to our
                    business and scientific values that constitute the core of
                    our philosophy. Thanks a lot for our customers and employee
                    for the trust they place on Royal Pharma, we will continue
                    to do all we can to live up to this trust.
